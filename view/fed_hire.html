<h2> Does the Federal government hire people with disabilities? </h2>
</div>

<br>

<p>
People with disabilities are able to apply for jobs with the
Federal Government through the traditional hiring process.
In addition, the Federal Government has a non-competitive
hiring process for people with disabilities called the Schedule A.
This section of the Toolkit contains information on the Schedule A.

<h2> Schedule A Hiring Process </h2>

<p>
People with disabilities can be appointed to Federal jobs through a non-competitive
process called the Schedule A. The Schedule A is a special hiring process for people
with disabilities.
<br>
<br>
You can apply using the Schedule A if you are a person with an intellectual disability,
a severe physical disability, or a psychiatric disability.
Being eligible for the Schedule A will help you in the hiring process, but it will not
guarantee you a Federal job. In order to be selected you will need to show that you
meet the qualifications of the specific job that you are applying for. (With or without
a reasonable accommodation)
<br>
<br>
Employees hired under the Schedule A are held to the same performance standards
as all other Federal employees.
<br>
<br>
Please review the information on the following pages for more detailed information
on the application process.

	      <div class="panel-body">
	      	To apply using Schedule A, you will need to submit documentation that proves you
have an intellectual disability, severe physical disability, or psychiatric disability. This is
called "Proof of Disability Documentation". This documentation shows that you are
eligible to apply using Schedule A because you have a disability. It’s best to have this
letter ready before you apply under Schedule A.
	      	<br>
	      	<br>
		  	You can request Proof of Disability Documentation from:
• Your doctor
• A licensed medical professional
• A licensed rehabilitation professional, such as SC Vocational Rehabilitation
• A federal or state agency that issues disability benefits, such as Social Security
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  The Proof of Disability Documentation needs to say that you are eligible to apply
using Schedule A. It does NOT need to include your specific disability, medical
history or need for accommodation. Sample “Schedule A Letters” can be found at

<h3>Approach 2: Apply directly with the agency using the Schedule A process</h3>
Most agencies have a Disability Program Manager (DPM) or Selective Placement Program
Coordinator (SPPC) whose job is to help the agency recruit, hire, and accommodate people
with disabilities.
Contact the DPM or SPPC at the agency where you want to work and ask how to apply for the
job using the Schedule A hiring process for people with disabilities. They can work with you to
make sure your resume and application are considered through Schedule A.
Go to <a href= "http://www.opm.gov/"> www.opm.gov </a> to find a list of Selective Placement Program Coordinators (SPPC) in
each agency.
It’s best to apply for a position through the regular vacancy announcement on USAJOBS and
then follow-up with the SPPC/DPM.
Contacting the SPPC/DPM can take time and it’s important that you meet the application
deadline that’s listed in the job announcement.
